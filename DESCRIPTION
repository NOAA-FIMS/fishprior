Description: This package extracts information the the FishLife R package
    to inform priors for parameters that are commonly included in
    assessment models of marine resources. The parameters of interest are
    life-history parameters such as natural mortality but can also pertain
    to parameters that are fishery-related but have implausible values due
    to life-history traits such as selectivity parameters.
